# Energy

### In this notebook, I am going to look into a couple datasets that provide insight into some energy consumption data around the world before I take a deeper look into a specific country's (India's) energy profile.


There are two screenshots in this repository. They are the culmination of the EDA and represent the locations/spread of different types of production. However, upon running the notebook, the graphic can be viewed in greater detail.
